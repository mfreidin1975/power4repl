Estimate power for discovery or replication for GWAS based on pilot data
Based on the fact that if H0!=0, then the test statistics follows chi2 distribution with a non-centrality parameter

Needs effect estimate (beta), SE for beta, discovery sample size, replication sample size, number of loci to replicate and a p-value pursued

INCORRECT! DO NOT USE!!!
